I have just started an integrated PhD and MSc at the new [Centre for Doctoral Training](https://datacdt.org), a joint venture by four northern universities; Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool.

Prior to starting a PhD, I worked as a Data Analyst for Sheffield City Council as part of the Troubled Families Data Team. Before this I studied Politics at Sheffield Hallam University before moving to the University of Sheffield to complete an MSc in Politics with Research Methods.
