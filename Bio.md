I have just started an integrated PhD and MSc at the new [Centre for Doctoral Training](https://datacdt.org), a joint venture by four northern universities; Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool. As part of the course there are 4 modules designed to improve data analysis skills. This website has been created as part of the Programming for Social Science module which was based in Leeds and Taught by Andy Evans.

Prior to starting a PhD, I worked as a Data Analyst for Sheffield City Council as part of the Troubled Families Data Team. Before this I studied Politics at Sheffield Hallam University before moving to the University of Sheffield to complete an MSc in Politics with Research Methods.
