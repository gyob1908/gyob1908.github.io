I have just started an integrated PhD and MSc at the new [Centre for Doctoral Training](https://datacdt.org), a joint venture by four northern universities; Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool. As part of the course there are 4 modules designed to improve data analysis skills. Each of these modules will take place at one of the four universities. This website was created as part of the first assignment for the Programming for Social Sciences module at the University Leeds but over the course of my research I will aim to add to the website.

Prior to starting a PhD, I worked as a Data Analyst for Sheffield City Council as part of the Troubled Families Data Team. Before this I studied Politics at Sheffield Hallam University before moving to the University of Sheffield to complete an MSc in Politics with Research Methods.
